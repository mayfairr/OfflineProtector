# OfflineProtector
Custom Rust plugin that integrates with the Rust:IO Clans plugin by dcode. It prevents offline raiding after x amount of mintues since a user has logged off. The offline raid protector uses scrap as currency, with prices being interchangeable using the config. After purchase of any tier there will be a cooldown that decreases only through game time.
